    "\n",
    "112233 meets these criteria because the digits never decrease and all repeated digits are exactly two digits long.\n",
    "123444 no longer meets the criteria (the repeated 44 is part of a larger group of 444).\n",
    "111122 meets the criteria (even though 1 is repeated more than twice, it still contains a double 22).\n",
